# centivo-challenge
This project sets up a simple Node.js API using Express and Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database. It includes an endpoint to fetch a user by ID with proper validation and error handling, along with bonus functionality to gracefully handle invalid ObjectId formats. The structure follows clear separation of concerns with modular routing and reusable database utilities.
